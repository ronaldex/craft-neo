# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- Fixed an error that occurred with Craft 3.5 / Neo 2.8 when rebuilding the project config, if any Neo block type field layout consisted only of blank tab(s)
- Fixed a bug with previous Neo 2.8 releases where default values on dropdown fields were not being applied to new Neo blocks
- Replaced the usage of various deprecated Twig classes

## 2.8.2 - 2020-08-05

### Changed
- Neo now requires Craft 3.5.0 or later

### Fixed
- Fixed a CSS issue where unselected Neo block tab content would still be displayed along with the selected tab's content when in live preview mode

## 2.8.1 - 2020-08-04

### Fixed
- Fixed a CSS issue where unselected Neo block tab content would still be displayed along with the selected tab's content
- Fixed a bug where Neo fields created prior to the 2.8.0 upgrade, and that had not since been saved, would cause the `craft project-config/apply` command to fail, due to the lack of `maxSiblingBlocks` property

## 2.8.0 - 2020-08-04

> {warning} As part of the changes to Neo 2.8 to support Craft 3.5's new field layout designer, it's no longer possible to save blank tabs in Neo block types' field layouts.  Existing blank tabs should be retained when upgrading to Craft 3.5 and Neo 2.8, but they will be lost if they're still blank next time the field is saved.  It's recommended to place a UI element in any blank tabs that should be kept.

### Added
- Full support for Craft 3.5's new field layout designer
- Added the `Max Sibling Blocks of This Type` block type setting, which sets the maximum number of blocks of that block type allowed under one parent block or at the top level

### Changed
- Neo now requires Craft 3.5.0-RC6 or later
- Updated node-sass to ^4.14.1

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `benf\neo\integrations\fieldlabels\FieldLabels`

> {note} ~This update contains a schema update which could potentially break the structure of the neo blocks. Make sure to backup your database and do the update locally first as it includes migration of all neo blocks. If the structure is indeed broken, re-saving the page should resolve it. See #336. I'm currently looking into this issue so it's best to wait at version v2.6.x for now.~
>
> The latest release v2.7.9+ has changes to the migration file + fixes the issue when updating from craft at 3.3 and lower #326 (this is most likely the cause of out of order/missing blocks).
